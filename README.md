__Project Description__

In the digital age, students are increasingly exposed to social media, which may have both positive and negative effects on mental well-being.

The goals of this project is to uncover which platforms have negative influence on the mental health of students between the ages of ... and... This data was gathered from Kaggle. The visualization of the results are represented on Tabluea Public page and the raw data clean up and analysis is done with python.

## Getting Started

__Tools & Technologies__

<li> Python: Core programming language

<li> Pandas / NumPy: Data wrangling

<li> Matplotlib / Seaborn: Data visualization


What are the primary analysis scripts/starting points? How would the analysis be rerun?

```
Give an example
```

### Requirements

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development/analysis env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using. It is also worth listing what the requirements are.
